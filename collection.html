                        This collection delves into the idea that history is written by the victors and that many profound stories
                        have been lost to time. Each piece in this collection reimagines these lost moments, presenting them in a way
                        that invites the viewer to question the accuracy of what we are taught and explore the depth of forgotten cultures.
